## Horrible Things!
This repository contains a blog post and accompanying code in which I attempt to imitate the style of a small Lua program by doing some horrible things in Haskell.

### Running the code:
You can run the original Lua code from the book [Programming in Lua](https://moys.gov.iq/upload/common/Programming_in_Lua,_4th_ed._(2017)_.pdf) with the following command:
```
lua lua/eight-queen-from-text.lua
```
I have run this with Lua version 5.4.4

You can run the Haskell clone of the program with the following command:
```
runhaskell haskell/eight-queen-from-text-clone.hs
```
I have run this using ghc version 9.6.4
